Python relies on indentation to indicate blocks of code. A colon at the end of a line is a signal that a new indented block of code will follow.

So, when no indented block is found after the final colon, the code execution stops and an IndentationError is thrown. Therefore, there's no output anymore.

Restore the indentation for your print(i) call.

in the alphabet, take the letter located after 3 positions in the alphabet,
and replace the original letter with the new letter.
