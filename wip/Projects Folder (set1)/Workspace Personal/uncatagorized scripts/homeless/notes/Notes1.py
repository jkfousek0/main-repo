# The .index() method is identical to the .find() method but it throws a
# ValueError exception if it is unable to find the substring.

# A ValueError is a built-in exception that is raised when an argument with
# the right type but inappropriate value is passed to a function.

#You need to write return followed by a space and the value that the function should return.
